        <p>Being able to read books (and see films) is really good and must be a part of our self-education.</p>
        <p>Here is a list of books and films that I have read or seen and that I recommend you to read or see.</p>

                    <p><span class="big_bald">1984</span></p>

                    <p>Mentionned in the Hobbies pages, 1984 is a Dystopian book made by <cite>Georges Orwell</cite></p>
                    <p>In this universe, the world is divided by three big powers : </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Eastasia</li>
                        <li>Oceania</li>
                        <li>Eastasia</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>And the main character, Winston Smith, is a worker in the Ministry of Truth, where he is in
                        charge of
                        rewriting the history of the world.</p>
                    <p>Between destructions, war, Big Brothers and love, this book is the representation of the
                        imagination of Georges Orwell.</p>

                <p>But, when we look about the French Professor of Georges Orwell, we found Aldous Huxley.</p>
                <p>And M.Huxley write also a dystopian book, called </p>

                <div class="dystopian">
                    <p><span class="big_bald">Brave New World</span></p>
                    <p id="note">Did you see this transition !?</p>
                    <p>Brave New World is a dystopian book made by <cite>Aldous Huxley</cite></p>
                    <p>In this universe, there is international state.</p>
                    <p>The humanity is classed under 5 castes : </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Alphas, the elites of the Humanity, tall and smart</li>
                        <li>The Betas, the smart workers</li>
                        <li>The Gammas, the working class</li>
                        <li>The Deltas, small, unintelligent, programmed to make the manual work.</li>
                        <li>The Epsilons, how the f*** they live !?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each class is sub-divided by two classes, the plus and the minus class.</p>
                    <p>In this eugenic world, we follow the story of Bernard Marx, an Alpha plus with some deformation
                        due to some alchool in his test-tube. </p>
                    <div class="video" id="bnw">
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXauzZ-DdOk" target="_blank"><img src="img/bnw.png"

                </div>
                <p>Even if 1984 and Brave New World are big classics in the dystopian world, this duality between "the
                    old world" and the over-technologied world represents, I think, our world today at some place in
                    this world.</p>

                            <p><cite>Interstellar by Christopher Nolan</cite></p>
                        </div>
                        <p><cite>Do not go gentle into that good night... Old age should burn and rave at the close of
                                day... Rage, rage against the dying of the light... </cite></p>
                        <p>Interstellar is definitly, one of the most beutiful film in the 21th century.</p>
                        <p>It's just so hard to explain why but i'll try to make a list of argument</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The story is excellent, Nolan is well known to be litteraly, an artist and a specialist
                                of storymaking.</li>
                            <li>THE MUSIC ! OH MY F****** GOD ! Almost all the musics in this film are maded by Hans
                                Zimmer, the mix between classical, modern and THE ORGAN is just arrgh! </li>
                            <li>From the scientist point of view, almost all the theory, the calculous, the images have
                                been verified
                                by Kip Thorne, a (just) nobel price of Physics (yeah, just that.) </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>And the last argument, the most important, the most beautiful, the most...
                            <cite>Interstellar</cite> is a film about the human, about the love, about the family, about
                            the life. (and the time)
                        </p>
                        <p>You can (and you must) review this film, again, again and again ! </p>

                        <p>Dune is a film made by Denis De Villeneuve (sadly no, not a french...) and ALSO ! (hehe you didn't see that) a Sci-Fi series made by.... *drums*</p>
                        <p>Frank Herbert !</p>
                        <p class="note">So yes, technically, it's an adaptation...</p>
                        <p>The whole Dune lore is a mix between religions, space, drugs (yes.) and ethos</p>
                        <p>The universe of Dune is endeless, everytime I read the three mains book, I discover new things, new point of view and I elaborate new theory every time. </p>
